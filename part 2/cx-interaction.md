>There are a few questions I need to resolve:
>1) I would like to add the sales person that closed a deal to a customer profile in ChartMogul so that I can

>2) Another issue I had is that I canâ€™t wrap my head around how proration works in ChartMogul.
>Here is my scenario:

>1. For that specific scenario, I would suggest implementing this as an attribute to simpler filtering and segmentation. You can read more about attributes here https://help.chartmogul.com/hc/en-us/articles/206120219-Customer-attributes. Depending on the system you use, we have a couple of different automated ways to intergrate your attribute. I would say the simplest would be using our Google Sheets integration as demonstrated here https://help.chartmogul.com/hc/en-us/articles/207251069.
