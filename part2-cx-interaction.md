>There are a few questions I need to resolve:
>1) I would like to add the sales person that closed a deal to a customer profile in ChartMogul so that I can

>2) Another issue I had is that I canâ€™t wrap my head around how proration works in ChartMogul.
>Here is my scenario:
>- My customer is on a monthly plan called Pro plan that costs $60 which they paid for on November 1st at
